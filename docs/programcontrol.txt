Program Control Class
Girum Tekle

The program control class is responsible for connecting the command line to the file handler, requesting
file contents and returning readable text.

When the program is executed with no arguments, this part of the program should provide a list of files
available, along with a corresponding number.


--------------------------------------
- fileHandler: FileHandler
- cipher: Cipher
--------------------------------------
+ ProgramControl(fileHandler: FileHandler)
+ handleRequest(args: String[]): String
- formatFileList(files: ArrayList<String>): String


Zero Arguments: ProgramControl will request a list of available files from FileHandler and then
format the list into a number string (e.g. 01 filename.txt)

One Argument: With a number provided ProgramControl maps the number to the corresponding file and sends
it to get decrypted with default key and returns the result.

Two Arguments: Follows the same steps as one argument but maps to an alternate key for decryption



Use Mockito to simulate FileHandler responses.

Unit Testing Plan

Input: []               Expected: Formatted list "01 file.txt", "02 file.txt", etc

Input: ["01"]           Expected: Retrieves contents of first file, deciphers with key.txt

Input: ["01","xxx.txt"] Expected: Retrieves contents, deciphers with xxx.txt

Input: ["60"]          Expected: "File index 60 is out of range."

Input: ["bcde"]            Expected: "Please enter a valid file number."
