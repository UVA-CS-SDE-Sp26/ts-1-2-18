Cipher Class
Sae-Jin Moon

The Cipher class's primary responsibility is to perform character substitution based on a plain and cipher key map.
This converts the ciphered text into readable text.
I implemented it with handling cases for capitalization, punctuation, and malformed key files using defensive programming.
This keeps the program running properly even with incomplete data.

--------------------------------------
- key: String
- ciphered_string: String
--------------------------------------
+ Cipher(ciphered_string: String)
+ Cipher(ciphered_string: String, key: String)
+ decipher(): String
+ decipher(keyPath: String): String
- process(keyContent: String): String
+ getCipheredString(): String
+ setCipheredString(ciphered_string: String)
+ getKey(): String
+ setKey(key: String)
--------------------------------------

Standard Decipher: Uses the key string stored during object initialization to process the ciphered text.

Path-based Decipher: Accepts a file path as a string, attempts to read the file contents as a new key,
and processes the text using that specific key. If the file cannot be read, it returns the original
ciphered string.

Substitution Logic: The key is split into two lines (Normal and Cipher). The class iterates through
the ciphered text, finds the index of each character in the Cipher line, and replaces it with the
corresponding character from the Normal line.

Case & Punctuation: The algorithm is case-insensitive for matching but preserves the original
capitalization of the input in the output. Characters not found in the key (spaces, punctuation, etc.)
are passed through to the result unchanged.

Defensive Handling: If the key content contains fewer than two lines or if null values are encountered,
the class returns the original string to prevent data loss or runtime crashes.


Unit Testing Plan

Input: key: "ABC\nXYZ", text: "X y Z!"
Expected: "A b C!" (Preserves capitalization, spaces, and punctuation)

Input: key: "ABC", text: "Hello"
Expected: "Hello" (Handles incomplete keys with only one line)

Input: keyPath: "invalid_path.txt"
Expected: Original String (Gracefully handles IO/File not found errors)

Input: key: "ABC\nXY", text: "XYZ"
Expected: "ABZ" (Handles keys where mapping lines are of unequal lengths)

Input: key: null, text: "Data"
Expected: "Data" (Handles null key initialization)
