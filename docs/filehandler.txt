This program is responsible for reading the text file and outputting its text stream.
It has a getter and setter method for variable filepath and a central method called ReadFile.
Readfile takes filepath as an argument and attempts to read the file and output it. This
throws an exception if the file is not found.
String variable file_data is returned
